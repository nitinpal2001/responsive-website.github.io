                I don't blame
                you. He runs, like, nine ridiculously transformative, forward-thinking companies. How could anyone but a
                superhero do that, right?
                Wrong. Musk reminds us that he is just an ordinary person who has chosen to be extraordinary. You can do
                the
                same. You should do the same!</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ray Allen really moved me in his "Letter to My Younger Self." His father
                was in the military because they moved a lot, and the kids made fun of him because he "talked like a
                white boy."

                At the time, he felt pretty alone, so he focused all of his energy into basketball. Still to this day,
                he pretty much is alone, he admits. But, today, he's at peace with his life and happy.

                When you're younger, life is all about fitting in, but when you're older, life is all about standing
                out. Standing out is how you land jobs, how you get paid more and how you make it to the top. So don't
                steer away from standing out. Embrace it.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">I wasted two years of my life pursuing business school, regardless of
                the fact that I sucked (and despised) at math. Business classes were all math all the time, and it made
                me delay doing my passion -- writing.

                One day, I remember calling my father crying. I told him I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to study
                something I was good at -- writing. I was told him I thought I wanted to apply to journalism school.
                I'll never forget what he said to me:

                "Lauren, do what you love, and the money will follow." </p>
